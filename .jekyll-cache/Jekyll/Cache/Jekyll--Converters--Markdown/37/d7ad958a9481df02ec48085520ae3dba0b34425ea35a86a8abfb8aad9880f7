<p>Appy is a mood journal chat bot that allows you explain your feelings in a moment. Normal pen and paper mood journals arenâ€™t always convenient, and the delay between an experience and finding time to write can make it difficult to recall emotions and leads to lower compliance rates. With this in mind, we made APPY, a journal capable of natural language processing that could  be accessed from your smartphone.</p>
