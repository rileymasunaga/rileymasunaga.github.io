Appy is a mood journal chat bot that allows you explain your feelings in a moment. Normal pen and paper mood journals aren’t always convenient, and the delay between an experience and finding time to write can make it difficult to recall emotions and leads to lower compliance rates. With this in mind, we made APPY, a journal capable of natural language processing that could  be accessed from your smartphone.

Backburner is an Startup Weekend Yokohama Project based on the Zeigarnik effect, the psychological theory that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. Over 3 days, our team of mostly students, developed a system which allows you to study material, but regularly interrupts you in order to increase levels of engagement with the material.
